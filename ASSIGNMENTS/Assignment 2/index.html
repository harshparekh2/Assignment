          BREAKING : US Determines Genocide in Sudan, Sanctions RSF Leader
          Hemedti
        </h1>
        <hr />
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          <b>John Prendergast, co-founder of The Sentry</b>, said: “RSF leader
          General Hemedti is ultimately responsible for some of the most heinous
          atrocities being committed anywhere in the world today. Without
          serious measures of legal and financial accountability, the RSF will
          continue its rampage. Today’s actions by the Biden administration –
          including the genocide determination as well as sanctions against
          Hemedti and some of the foreign firms profiting from Sudan’s chaos –
          are an important start to creating that accountability. These actions
          hopefully can provide leverage both for deterring future human rights
          crimes as well as for helping to drag the RSF into treating ceasefire
          negotiations more seriously.”
        </p>
        <div class="row-img">
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>Brian Adeba, Senior Advisor at The Sentry</b>, said: “For far too
            long, mass atrocities that amount to genocide have occurred in the
            Darfur region of Sudan. In the current conflict, these atrocities
            have been recorded in several regions of the country. Today’s
            genocide determination sends a strong message to victims that their
            suffering is recognized, and justice is being sought. Most
            importantly, the determination signals that the world is waking up
            to the task of holding those who commit mass atrocities accountable.
            This determination must be accompanied by bold and concrete action
            to not only hold perpetrators accountable, but also protect
            civilians, and support the pursuit of justice and peace in Sudan.

          BREAKING : “Deepening descent” into corruption in Libya, “parallels
          with Syria”
        </h1>
        <hr />
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <b>Charles Cater, Director of Investigations at The Sentry</b>, said:
          “The Dabaiba family, who now holds power in Tripoli and who previously
          oversaw Libya’s public works sector during Qadhafi’s rule in the
          2000s, bears responsibility for mismanaging crucial infrastructure
          contracts, including a gross lack of maintenance of the Derna dam.
          Their misconduct contributed to the tragic catastrophe in Derna, which
          destroyed a historic city and killed thousands. Now, the ongoing
          reconstruction of Derna presents similar risks. With Field Marshal
          Haftar and his family controlling the rebuilding process, there are
          renewed signs of abuse and fund misappropriation. The secret
          deal-making and opaque operations of the Haftars should raise red
          flags for corruption and renewed concerns for infrastructure
          integrity.”

              Sentry</b
            >
            said: “International policymakers should require maximum
            transparency from the reconstruction funds managed by Field Marshal
            Khalifa Haftar’s faction in eastern Libya, insisting that they
            submit to oversight from legitimate Libyan financial institutions
            like the Audit Bureau. More broadly, law enforcement and financial
            authorities in the US, UK, Europe, and in other nations with an
            interest in supporting a more stable, secure region should help
            investigate the past misappropriation of Libyan infrastructure
            funds, work to return these resources to the Libyan people, and step
            up efforts to counter a deepening descent into kleptocracy.”

        <hr />
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <b>Rajasthan Royals (RR) ended Royal Challengers Bangalore's (RCB)</b
          >, thrilling run in the Indian Premier League (IPL) with a gritty
          four-wicket win in the Eliminator on Wednesday. After their bowlers
          restricted RCB to 172/8, RR's batters faced a challenging middle
          phase, allowing RCB to remain in the contest. Despite the tension, the
          2008 champions eventually secured the victory with an over to spare,
          finishing at 174/6 thanks to Rovman Powell's unbeaten 16.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Riyan Parag played a crucial role, scoring 36 off 26 balls, displaying
          resilience under pressure to keep RR in the tournament. This victory
          marked Royals' first win after four losses and an abandoned game. They
          will now face Sunrisers Hyderabad in Chennai on Friday for a place in
          the IPL final.

          Shimron Hetmyer, making a comeback, contributed a vital 26 off 14
          balls. The game saw fluctuating fortunes, with RR staying ahead
          through impactful performances, although Mohammed Siraj's 2/33 for
          RCB's Mohammed Siraj created late excitement by dismissing Parag and
          Hetmyer in the 18th over.

          With 13 runs needed from the last two overs, Powell's three boundaries

          had set the pace at the top with a brisk 45 off 30 balls.
